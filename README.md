# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is a project that aims to cluster customers based on their purchase history and demographics in order to improve marketing strategies. By dividing customers into distinct groups, businesses can gain valuable insights into their preferences, behaviors, and characteristics. These insights can then be used to tailor marketing campaigns, personalize product offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview
The Customer Segmentation project involved the following key steps:
### Data Collection: 
Gathered customer data, including purchase history, demographic information, and any other relevant variables.
### Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing outliers.
### Feature Engineering: 
Created new variables from existing ones to capture additional information and improve the predictive power of the model. This involved calculating customer lifetime value, deriving customer segments based on demographics, or extracting behavioral metrics.
### Dimensionality Reduction: 
Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most important information. This helped uncover underlying patterns and relationships among the variables.
### Exploratory Data Analysis: 
Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the customer data. Visualized the relationships between variables, identified trends, and discovered meaningful patterns that could guide the segmentation process.
### Clustering: 
Applied clustering algorithms, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, to group customers based on similarities in their purchase history, demographics, or other relevant factors. This allowed for the identification of distinct customer segments.
### Interpretation and Insights: 
Analyzed the resulting customer segments and interpreted their characteristics. Explored the unique traits, preferences, and behaviors of each segment to gain actionable insights that could inform marketing strategies, product development, and customer engagement initiatives.

### Insights from all segments:

Cluster 0: 
- Have a family with 2-4 members.
- A lot of them have a teenager.
- The age of customers from this cluster is around 50 years.
- High spending & Average income group.

Cluster 1: 
- Relatively younger.
- Most do not have any children.
- Family members 1-3.
- Low spending & Low income group.

Cluster 2:
- Most have 1 child at max.
- Family members 1-2.
- Highest spenders of all the groups.
- High spending & High income group.

Cluster 3:
- Family has 3-5 members.
- Have 1-3 children with atleast one teenager.
- Spend the least.
- Low spending & High income group.

When it comes to promotions, it's fascinating to see how different groups of people respond. Not everyone embraces promotions with open arms; in fact, the majority of individuals tend to pass on them altogether. It's intriguing to delve into the reasons behind this behavior and explore the various factors that influence people's decisions. By understanding why some individuals are less inclined to accept promotions, businesses can fine-tune their marketing strategies and tailor their offers to better meet the needs and preferences of different customer segments. It's a captivating area of study that unravels the complexities of human behavior and sheds light on the diverse responses to promotional initiatives.
